<h1>VocalVision</h1>
VocalVision is a speech interpreter that can listen into meetings or hard-to-follow conversations using one mic and recognize who is speaking as well as transcribe what they are saying onto a display.

This device can have a majority of applications, the intended one being aiding deaf people in the interpretation of large-scale in-person meetings. Generally, it is immensely difficult to follow who is speaking and what they are saying when there are so many people participating in a conversation, so visualizing this onto a display can be of immense help.
